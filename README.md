# angular-magic-drafter

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-magic-drafter)

This application lets you generate "booster packs" for drafting from your existing collection.  For Magic: The Gathering drafting rules, see this link - https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft

Items still under development:
- Styling is very basic.  
- Expading the browser window to large or too small makes the cards unreadable, and extension of the sytling issue.
- Cards appear to be links, but go nowhere.  These need to link out to Scryfall, or display the card image.
